### Step 1: Prepare Input Files for DiCE

If you are running DiCE on **bulk RNA-seq** data, you need the following three input files:

1. **DGE data** – Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the differential gene expression analysis results of **protein coding genes**.
  - The columns must include: **"Gene.Symbol", "logFC", "P.Value", "adj.P.Val"**. 
  - Note: Column names in your data must exactly match the above.

2. **Normalized gene expression data** - Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the normalized (logCPM) gene expression data of **protein coding genes**.
  - Genes as rows and Samples as columns.
  - Do not keep genes as rownames. Keep them under Gene column.
  - Do not place sample names as the first column

3. **Meta data** – Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the sample information.
  - Samples as rows. 
  - Must contain:
    **sample_id** column matching sample names in the expression matrix
    **phenotype** column containing group/class labels. Example: If a sample is from a tumor tissue, the Group column should contain “Tumor”.

  - Note: Group labels are case-sensitive. Use the same column labels in gene expression file as sample IDs.


If you are running DiCE on **scRNA-seq** data, you need the following four input files:


1. **DGE data** – Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the differential gene expression analysis results of **protein coding genes**.
  - The columns must include: **"Gene.Symbol", "logFC", "P.Value", "adj.P.Val"**. 
  - Note: Column names in your data must exactly match the above.

2. **Normalized gene expression data** - Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the normalized (logCPM) gene expression data of **protein coding genes**.
  - Genes as rows and Samples as columns.
  - Do not keep genes as rownames. Keep them under Gene column.
  - Do not place sample names as the first column

3. **Raw gene expression data** - Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the raw UMI counts of the **protein coding genes**.
  - Genes as rows and Samples as columns.
  - Do not keep genes as rownames. Keep them under Gene column.
  - Do not place sample names as the first column

4. **Meta data** – Rds/xlsx/csv/tsv file containing the cell information.
  - Samples as rows. 
  - Must contain:
    **cell_id** column matching sample names in the expression matrix
    **phenotype** column containing group/class labels. Example: If a sample is from a tumor tissue, the Group column should contain “Tumor”.

  - Note: Group labels are case-sensitive. Use the same column labels in gene expression file as sample IDs.

For a centrality rule, a gene passes if it satisfies the specified cutoff in either the treatment or control network 						for that centrality. For an ensemble rule, a gene passes if its Ensemble_Rank satisfies the specified cutoff. Default uses Betweenness top 25% in either treatment or 						control network.
-**dice_logic** : Logic used to combine multiple rules in dice_rules. Options include:
					"AND" : A gene must pass all rules to be classified as a DiCE gene. Default.
					"OR" : A gene must pass at least one rule to be classified as a DiCE gene.
- **markTF**: If TRUE, transcription factor genes will be marked. Default FALSE.

---
### Instructions to define DiCE rules

**dice_rules** are used to define how final DiCE genes are selected after centrality calculation and ensemble ranking. Rules can be created using `dice_centrality_rule()` for centrality-based filtering and `dice_ensemble_rule()` for ensemble-rank-based filtering.

Each rule is evaluated separately. 

A gene is considered to pass a centrality-based rule if it satisfies the cutoff in either the treatment network or the control network for the selected centrality metric. For example, if the rule is based on Betweenness, the logic is:

`(Betweenness_treatment passes cutoff) | (Betweenness_control passes cutoff)`

For `dice_centrality_rule(metric, threshold_type, threshold)`:
- **metric** specifies the centrality measure to evaluate, such as "betweenness", "eigenvector", "pagerank", or other supported centrality metrics.
- **threshold_type** specifies how the cutoff should be interpreted. The cutoff depends on threshold_type:
		- "mean": the gene must have a centrality value greater than or equal to the mean centrality value in either treatment or control. In this case, **threshold** is not required.
		- "percent": the gene must have a centrality value greater than or equal to the cutoff defined by the top specified percentage in either treatment or control. For example, 					threshold = 25 means the gene must be greater than or equal to the 75th percentile in either network.
		- "rank": the gene must fall within the top specified rank in either treatment or control. Here, **threshold** should be a rank value such as 200.
- **threshold** provides the numeric cutoff value when required.

An `dice_ensemble_rule(threshold_type, threshold)` rule is evaluated using Ensemble_Rank. A gene passes if its ensemble **rank** is within the specified cutoff.

When multiple rules are provided, they are combined using **dice_logic**:
- "AND": the gene must pass all rules
- "OR": the gene must pass at least one rule

A gene that satisfies the final combined logic is labeled as DiCE; otherwise, it keeps its previous phase label.

#### Example 1: single centrality rule

```r
dice_rules <- list(
  dice_centrality_rule(
    metric = "betweenness",
    threshold_type = "mean"
  )
)
dice_logic <- "AND"
```
This means a gene is classified as DiCE if:
`(Betweenness_treatment >= mean(Betweenness_treatment)) | (Betweenness_control  >= mean(Betweenness_control))`

#### Example 2: multiple centrality rules
```r
dice_rules <- list(
  dice_centrality_rule("betweenness", "mean"),
  dice_centrality_rule("eigenvector", "mean")
)
dice_logic <- "AND"
```
This means a gene is classified as DiCE if:

`((Betweenness_treatment >= mean(Betweenness_treatment)) | (Betweenness_control  >= mean(Betweenness_control))) & ((EigenVector_treatment >= mean(EigenVector_treatment)) | (EigenVector_control  >= mean(EigenVector_control)))`

#### Example 3: centrality rule plus ensemble rule

```r
dice_rules <- list(
  dice_centrality_rule("betweenness", "percent", 25),
  dice_ensemble_rule("rank", 200)
)
dice_logic <- "AND"
```
This means a gene is classified as DiCE if it is:
	- within the top 25% of Betweenness in either treatment or control, and
	- within the top 200 genes by Ensemble_Rank

#### Default rule

If no custom rule is provided, the default DiCE rule is:

```r
dice_rules <- list(
  dice_centrality_rule(
    metric = "betweenness",
    threshold_type = "percent",
    threshold = 25
  ),
  dice_centrality_rule(
    metric = "eigen vector",
    threshold_type = "percent",
    threshold = 25
  )
)
dice_logic <- "AND"
```

```r
dice_rules = list(
  dice_centrality_rule(
    metric = "betweenness",
    threshold_type = "percent",
    threshold = 25
    
  ),
  dice_centrality_rule(
    metric = "eigen vector",
    threshold_type = "percent",
    threshold = 25
  )
)
dice_logic <- "AND"

dice_results <- perform_DiCE(
  species = "mouse",
  data_type = "scRNA-seq",
  dge_file_path = "path/to/dge_results.rds",
  normGeneExp_file_path = "path/to/logNorm_geneExp.rds",

  ig_method = "IG",
  B = 300,
  ig_cutoff = "all_nonzero",
  ig_custom_cutoff = NULL, 
  corr_mode = "newwave",
  n_denoise_latent = 5,
  max_denoise_iters = 1000,
  corr_method = "spearman",
  corr_pval_cutoff = 1,
  stringDB_confidence = 400,
  centrality_list = c("betweenness", "eigen vector"),
  dice_rules = dice_rules,
  dice_logic = dice_logic,
  markTF = TRUE
) 

# View DiCE genes
head(dice_results$dice_results_df)
```

**Note**: For scRNA-seq data, if are not using Information Gain (ig_method = none), you do not need to input normalized gene expression data. Providing differential gene expression data and gene raw counts is enough.

### (Optional): Identify **condition-sepcific weighted** PPI network modules,

`detect_PPI_weightedModules()` identifies condition-specific modules in weighted PPI networks for a given gene set. It constructs treatment and control networks using condition-specific edge weights, detects communities, and summarizes module structure and node-level roles.

- **Input:** Gene list, PPI interaction table with condition-specific edge weights, and names of treatment and control conditions.
	- For the PPI interaction table, you can use `dice_results$interactions_df`. 
	- Otherwise, the table must contain the columns `source`, `target`, `weight_Tumor`, and `weight_Normal` when the treatment is `Tumor` and the control is `Normal`.
- **Output:** Module summaries (`network_modules`), module statistics (`module_stats`), module overlap between conditions (Jaccard similarity `cmp_jaccard` and common gene counts `cmp_count`), node-level module role statistics (`nodes_stats`), all the edges with modules information(`edges_with_modules`), and condition specific intermodule connectivity
(`treatment_interMod`, `control_interMod`).
	

**Node-level module role statistics**  (`nodes_stats`) table describes the network role of each gene within the detected modules.

	- **Condition** – Condition in which the network role was calculated (e.g., Tumor or Normal). 
	- **Gene.Symbol** – Gene corresponding to the network node. 
	- **Module** – Module (community) the gene belongs to in that condition. 
	- **Within_Module_Z** – Within-module degree z-score. Measures how strongly the gene is connected to other genes within its own module. Higher values indicate hub-like genes within 								the module.
	- **Participation_Coefficient** – Measures how evenly a gene’s connections are distributed across different modules. Higher values indicate connector genes linking multiple modules.
	- **Intra_Module_Degree** – Weighted degree of connections within the gene’s own module.
	- **Inter_Module_Degree** – Weighted degree of connections from the gene to genes in other modules.


Configure the parameters for `detect_PPI_weightedModules()`:

- **gene_list** : Character vector of genes to retain in the networks.
- **interactions** : Data frame of interactions with `source`, `target`, and condition-specific weight columns named `weight_<condition>` (e.g., `weight_Tumor`).
- **treatment** : Character string naming the treatment condition (used to select `weight_<treatment>`. E.g., "Tumor").
- **control** : Character string naming the control condition (used to select `weight_<control>`. E.g., "Normal").
- **algorithm** : Community detection algorithm to use. Options are "louvain" (default) or "leiden". Louvain is fast and widely used, while Leiden provides improved partition quality and guarantees well-connected communities.
- **resolution** : Resolution parameter controlling the granularity of detected modules. Higher values lead to more (smaller) modules, while lower values result in fewer (larger) modules. Default is 1.
- **leiden_itrs** : Number of iterations for the Leiden algorithm. More iterations can improve stability and quality of community detection, but increase computation time. Default is 3.
- **leiden_beta** : Randomness parameter for the Leiden algorithm. Controls the level of randomness during node reassignment. Higher values introduce more randomness, potentially escaping local optima. Default is 0.01.
- **seed** : Random seed for reproducibility (default 123).



#' @param seed Random seed for reproducibility (default 123).

Example to find condition-sepcific weighted modules.

```r
res <- detect_PPI_weightedModules(
			gene_list = my_genes,
			interactions_df = intr_df,
			treatment = "Tumor",
			control = "Normal",
			louvain_resolution = 0.9,
			seed = 123
)

# View network stats of the nodes in each module
head(res$nodes_stats)

```

### (Optional): Identify **unweighted** PPI network modules (not a condition-specific analysis)

`detect_PPI_unweightedModules()` identifies community modules in an unweighted STRING v12 PPI network for a given gene set. It extracts STRING interactions for the selected genes (combined score ≥ 400), builds the PPI graph, detects Louvain communities, and returns module summaries, gene-to-module assignments, and intra-module interaction tables.

- **Input:**
	- **gene_list** : genes for the module analysis
	- **interactions** : Data frame of interactions with `source`, `target`
	- **algorithm** : Community detection algorithm to use. Options are "louvain" (default) or "leiden". Louvain is fast and widely used, while Leiden provides improved partition quality and guarantees well-connected communities.
	- **resolution** : Resolution parameter controlling the granularity of detected modules. Higher values lead to more (smaller) modules, while lower values result in fewer (larger) modules. Default is 1.
	- **leiden_itrs** : Number of iterations for the Leiden algorithm. More iterations can improve stability and quality of community detection, but increase computation time. Default is 3.
	- **leiden_beta** : Randomness parameter for the Leiden algorithm. Controls the level of randomness during node reassignment. Higher values introduce more randomness, potentially escaping local optima. Default is 0.01.
	- **seed** : random seed for reproducibility

- **Output:** 
  - `summary_df`: Summary of number of modules and modularity
  - `module_stats_df`: Number of nodes and intra-module edges in each module
  - `membership_df`: Module assignments and within-module degrees
  - `between_module_edges_df` : Number of inter-module edges connecting each pair of modules
  - `all_edges_df` : All retained edges with Gene1, Gene2, combined_score, Gene1_Module, and Gene2_Module
  - `edges_by_module` : List of intra-module interaction tables for each module


Example to find unweighted network modules.

```r
# Run module detection on DiCE genes
modules <- detect_PPI_unweightedModules(
     gene_list = my_genes,
     interactions_df = intr_df,
     seed = 123
)

# View module membership
head(modules$membership_df)

```
